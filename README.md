# Learning Rust
Documenting my learning process with the Rust programming language.

## Installation and Setup
* https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Check that installation worked:
```
rustc --version
cargo --version
```
Shows release number, commit hash and commit date.

## Development Notes
* Compile: `rustc <file>.rs`
* Create a project
    * Go to project directory, then run: `cargo new <project name>`
* Build a project: `cd <project-name; cargo build`
* Run a Cargo project: `cd <project-name>; cargo run`
    * This compiles and runs the project


## Language Notes
* Variables are immutable by default. Need `mut` for mutability.
    * `let mut level = 10;`
* Immutable: `str`, mutable: `String` (allocated on the heap!)
    * Can't do `let name: str = "atskae"`, need to use `&str`.

* Structs
    * Classic C structs: `struct Student { name: String, level: u8 }`
        * Doesn't need a semicolon at the end
    * Tuple struct: `struct Animal(char, f32);`
        * Defines the field types of the tuple to be instantiated later
        * But this needs a semicolon at the end???
    * Union struct: `struct Unit`
    * To print structs with `println!()`, add `#[derive(Debug)]` before the struct definition

* String funkiness
    * When instantiating structs with string fields, need: `String::from("my string")`, convert `String` to `&str`...

* Functions
    * Can return values two ways:
        * `return <val>;` <-- Note semicolon here
        * `<val>` <-- Note *no* semicolon here
        * I don't like that...

* Printing stuff
    * Add `#[derive(Debug)]` before struct definitions to be able to print them
    * `{:?}` let's us print vectors
    * `{:#}` is this pretty print??

* Arrays and Vectors
    * Vectors are *not* mutable by default...
        * Need: `let mut fruits = Vec::new();`


## Rust Project Structure
Result of `cargo new ...`:
```
rust-project/
    Cargo.toml <-- contains metadata and dependencies
    src/
        main.rs <--- function main() is the entry point
        ...
```
